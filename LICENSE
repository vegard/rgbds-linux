"The executables are free to use, either for personal hobby use, or full
blown commercial productions--I know of at least a dozen commercial
games you can purchase that are written with RGBDS--and the source code
is free to modify.

the executables or source code, and any derivative works you give
credit to the original authors of the tools. That means you have to say
'Thanks' to the original authors SurfSmurf and Otaku."
