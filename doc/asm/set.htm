<h1>SET</h1>
<p>SETs are like <a href="equ.htm">EQUates</a> also constant symbols in the sense that their values are defined during the assembly process. These symbols are normally used in macros.</p>
<pre>KINKYCOUNT     SET  2
KINKYCOUNT     SET  DONUT_ISGOOD+KINKYCOUNT</pre>
<p>Note that a colon (:) following the label-name is not allowed. SETs can be exported and imported but the result is undefined and might change in a later release. Alternatively you can use = as a synonym for SET.</p>
