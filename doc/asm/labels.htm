<h1>Labels</h1>
<p>One of the assembler’s main tasks is to keep track of addresses for you so you dor’t have to remember obscure numbers but can make do with a meaningful name, a label.</p>
<p>This can be done in a number of ways:</p>
<pre>GlobalLabel
AnotherGlobal:
.locallabel
.yet_a_local:
ThisWillBeExported::        ;note the two colons</pre>
<p>This  is very similar to other assemblers. Local labels are  only accessible within the scope they are defined. A scope starts after a global label and ends at the next global label. You  may  or  may not have seen the <b>::</b> feature  before. It declares a normal global label but does an <a href="export.htm">EXPORT</a> at the same time.</p>
<p>Labels will normally change their value during the <a href="../link.htm">link process</a> and are thus <em>not</em> constant.</p>
