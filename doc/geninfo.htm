	<td><p>RGBDS fixes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>RGBFix can now also truncate the ROM-images to a valid size.
	<li>RGBAsm supports the LDD and LDI syntax plus [HLD] and [HLI]. LDH is synonymous with LDIO.
	<li>Example filenames have been changed to adhere to Jeff Frohweins proposed standard.
</ul>
	<p>General fixes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>RGBLink knows about big and little endian. Plus it can do range checking on intermediate results in an expression. This is necessary to support
different types of CPUs.
	<li>RGBLink <em>didn’t</em> know about the special PC symbol “@” so if you used it more than once per sourcefile in an expression the linker had to resolve, things would go horribly wrong.
	<li>There was a bug in the macro parameter passing. Any whitespace after the last parameter would be appended to the last parameter. Reported by Jeff Frohwein.
	<li>A section stack has been implemented. Look up POPS and PUSHS in the
manual. Jeff Frohwein’s doing again.
	<li>OPT command added for defining and changing some options while assembling.
	<li>You can now define which characters are used for the Gameboy graphics integer (`) using the commandline or the new OPT command. Cool idea by (surprise surprise) Jeff Frohwein.
	<li>Also, an option stack has been added. Look up POPO and PUSHO in the manual.
	<li>Fixed yet another line number bug reported by Jeff Frohwein (when will this guy leave me alone? ;)
</ul>

	<td>1.02</td>
	<td>22 July 1997</td>
	<td><p>General fixes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The lamest typo bug of all time has been fixed. RGBAsm would output a word defined with DW as 4 bytes instead of 2. Jeff Frohwein reported this.
	<li>The first line of an included file didn’t assemble correctly.
	<li>-b option added for setting the characters used for binary constants.
</ul>

	<td>21 Sep 1997</td>
	<td><p>General fixes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The assembler would crash if you tried to use a macro symbol in an expression.  (Jeff Frohwein)
	<li>You couldn’t use STRCMP, STRLEN and STRIN in relocatable expressions. (Harry P. Mulder)
	<li>Relocatable symbols are no longer allowed as arguments to the DEF function.
	<li>Finally! A librarian and smart linking has been added.
	<li>Bug fixed in the assembler where it would sometimes write out too many bytes for HRAM section definitions.
	<li>-z options (set fill value used for uninitialised data) added to the
assembler and linker.
	<li>The assembler will now read in any type of ASCII file on any type of OS.
